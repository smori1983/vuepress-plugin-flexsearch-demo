# Overview

A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through surrounding soil, earth or rock, and enclosed except for the entrance and exit, commonly at each end.
A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.

A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic, for rail traffic, or for a canal.
The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel.
Some tunnels are used as sewers or aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations.
Utility tunnels are used for routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment.

Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, or by civilians for smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people.
Special tunnels, such as wildlife crossings, are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely.
Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks.
