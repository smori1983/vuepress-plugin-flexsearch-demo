## Overview

In computer science, formal specifications are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software.
They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools.
These specifications are formal in the sense that they have a syntax, their semantics fall within one domain, and they are able to be used to infer useful information.


## Motivation

In each passing decade, computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and, as a result, they have become more impactful to society.
Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software.
Established engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of creating and validating product design.
Formal specifications are one such way to achieve this in software engineering reliability as once predicted.
Other methods such as testing are more commonly used to enhance code quality.
