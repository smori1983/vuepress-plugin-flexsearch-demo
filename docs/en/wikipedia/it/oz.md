## Overview

Oz is a multiparadigm programming language, developed in the Programming Systems Lab at Universit√© catholique de Louvain, for programming language education.


## Language feature

iIn addition to multi-paradigm programming, the major strengths of Oz are in constraint programming and distributed programming.
Due to its factored design, Oz is able to successfully implement a network-transparent distributed programming model.
This model makes it easy to program open, fault-tolerant applications within the language.
For constraint programming, Oz introduces the idea of computation spaces, which allow user-defined search and distribution strategies orthogonal to the constraint domain.
